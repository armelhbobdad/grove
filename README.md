![Grove](docs/images/home-hero-studio.png)

Grove is a workspace for you and your AI development team. Write a spec, send a sketch, hold a button and talk — every major coding agent runs in parallel, every change goes through review, every merge is a decision someone made. From your terminal, your browser, your desktop, or your phone.

> Grove treats **Studio** — the space where designers, PMs, and brand folks shape the product alongside AI — as a first-class surface. Code review is rigorous. But the product isn't just "a review tool that also has chat."

## What Grove gives you

### 🌿 Every agent, in parallel

Grove speaks ACP — ten agents built in, three more (Hermes, Kiro, OpenClaw) with first-class icons ready for custom configs. Each task runs in its own Git worktree with its own session, so ten agents can work at once without collision.

**Built-in:** Claude Code · Codex · Gemini CLI · GitHub Copilot · Cursor Agent · Junie · Trae CLI · Kimi · Qwen · OpenCode
**Ready for ACP:** Hermes · Kiro · OpenClaw
**Bring your own:** any binary that speaks ACP over stdio, or any HTTP endpoint.

### 🎨 Studio — for everyone on the team

Studio is the room inside Grove where non-coders join the AI workflow. Upload shared assets (hard-linked across worktrees), edit Project Memory and Workspace Instructions without touching the CLI, draw on a real Excalidraw canvas agents can read, and watch artifacts (D2 diagrams, Mermaid, images, code, HTML) render inline as the agents produce them.

### 🚢 Every merge, a decision

Review isn't just a diff. It's a threaded, resolvable, AI-assisted workspace. Comment on any line, discuss, let the AI fixer resolve your comments in a batch, and ship in one step — commit → rebase → merge → archive, with cross-branch safety and squash-merge detection built in.

### 🌐 Anywhere — TUI · Web · GUI · Mobile · Voice

One binary, four surfaces:
- **Web IDE** — the main event. FlexLayout with 10 panel types, IDE Layout mode, Studio, ⌘K command palette.
- **Desktop (Tauri)** — the same IDE in a native window. macOS DMG; Linux / Windows via feature flag.
- **Mobile** — LAN access with HMAC request signing, QR-code onboarding, optional TLS.
- **TUI** — the original keyboard-first surface. Still here, still fast.

Plus **Radio** — a walkie-talkie for your phone. Hold to speak; the transcript lands in the right chat or terminal in real time.

### 🧩 Skills, MCP, your own

Install a skill once, every installed agent gets smarter. Expose Grove via `grove mcp` so an orchestrator agent can manage your tasks. Plug in any custom agent with a launch command or URL. Notification hooks on every platform.

## Who Grove is for

Grove serves three kinds of people on the same project:

- **Power developers** — Web IDE with FlexLayout, Blitz across projects, 10 agents in parallel; TUI when you want it.
- **Visual thinkers** — IDE Layout, Sketch canvases agents can read, click-through reviews, inline D2 / Mermaid.
- **Non-technical collaborators** — Studio to manage assets and memory; Radio to drive AI by voice from a phone. No terminal. No git. Still shipping.
