### Fixed

- **Unified diff multi-line comment button not appearing** — cross-side text selections in unified view now correctly show the comment button (side check restricted to split mode only)
- **Comment author showing "You" instead of git user name** — comment creation and replies now use `git user.name` from worktree config as default author, passed through frontend → API → backend
- **Comment placed at wrong line when anchor text has multiple matches** — `find_anchor()` now collects all matches and picks the one closest to the original line number, preventing relocation to earlier occurrences of common patterns like `if err != nil {`

## [0.4.10] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- **MCP review tools missing structured comment IDs** — `grove_read_review`, `grove_add_comment`, and `grove_reply_review` now return structured JSON responses with explicit `comment_id` fields, enabling AI agents to reliably extract IDs and reply to comments
- **Zellij sessions missing environment variables** — Zellij sessions now inject `GROVE_*` env vars via KDL layout `export` prefix in all pane commands
- **Review: Comment Detail Modal not refreshing after reply** — expanded comment now derives from latest comments array by ID, so replies appear immediately
- **Review: Esc key in Comment Detail Modal exiting Review mode** — Esc now uses layered capture-phase handling: closes reply form first, then modal, without propagating to parent

### Added

- **Project name tag** — task headers now display the project name as an inline tag badge next to the task name (TaskInfoPanel, TaskView header, and compact toolbar)

### Changed

- **Blitz mode: removed task float-to-top** — selecting a task no longer reorders the list; tasks stay in their natural sort order
- **Blitz mode: single-click enters terminal** — clicking a task now directly opens the terminal view (previously required double-click)
- **Blitz mode: periodic card sweep effect** — selected task card shows a subtle left-to-right highlight sweep that repeats every few seconds
- **Review: Conversation Sidebar filtered in Changes mode** — comments are now filtered to only show those belonging to files visible in the current diff
- **Review: Conversation Sidebar click behavior** — project comments expand on click; file comments navigate to file; inline comments scroll to the exact line
- **Review: Comment Detail Modal Reply button** — now uses theme highlight color instead of muted gray

## [0.4.8] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- **Icon loading race condition** — fixed race condition in app icon extraction caused by shared temp file names
  - Now uses unique temp files (target path + nanoseconds) to prevent conflicts

- **TaskInfoPanel close button** — replaced confusing ArrowLeft icon with X icon for better UX
  - Clearer visual distinction between "close panel" and "collapse panel" actions

## [0.4.7] - 2026-02-08

### Changed

- **MCP `grove_reply_review`** — now only appends reply text, no longer changes comment status; added `author` field support
- **MCP `grove_add_comment`** — switched from `location` string to structured parameters (`file_path`, `start_line`, `end_line`, `content`, `author`)
- **MCP `grove_complete_task`** — description now emphasizes ONLY call when user explicitly requests; never automatically

### Added

- **`update_comment_status()` storage API** — dedicated function for changing comment open/resolved status, separated from reply logic
- **`PUT .../review/comments/{commentId}/status` REST endpoint** — Web UI now uses this dedicated endpoint for Resolve/Reopen actions

- **Enhanced hooks storage** — `HookEntry` model with `level`, `timestamp`, and optional `message`
  - Backward-compatible deserialization: old format (`task = "notice"`) parsed alongside new table format

### Changed

- **Toolbar action reorder** — Git actions (Commit, Rebase, Sync, Merge) now appear first, panel actions (Review, Editor) follow, in both Info panel and Terminal toolbar
- **Editor/Review mutual exclusion** — opening one panel automatically closes the other; terminal collapses for both

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-05

### Added

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed

- **Kill tmux session on monitor exit** — tmux session is now properly terminated when exiting the monitor view
- **difit session persistence** — difit review sessions are persisted across monitor restarts

- **difit output always empty** — `Stdio::null()` on stdin caused difit to exit immediately; removed stdin null to let difit run normally
- **Stale diff comments after re-review** — always overwrite saved comments file, even when review produces no comments

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- **Custom Layout Builder** — recursive wizard for building arbitrary tmux pane layouts
  - Binary tree model: Split (H/V) as internal nodes, Pane (Agent/Grove/Shell/Custom) as leaves
